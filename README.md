# My Cyberdian Project

This is my final dashboard project in order to join the Cyberdian Team !





## Installation

Install my-project with npm :

First, you can download every file in a zip folder. 
Extract the second folder from the zip folder and then name it as you want ("name_you_choose")


Then, use these commands in order to install and visualize my project :


```bash

  cd name_you_choose
  npm install
  npm run dev

```
Then, use the link you generated.
    
## Optimizations

There is no Responsive Design.
It means that it is more convinient for you to open it and visualize it with a 27 inches computer.

I hope you are satisfied with my final dashboard :)
